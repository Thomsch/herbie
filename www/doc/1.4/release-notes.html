    <h1>Herbie 1.4 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.4! This release focuses on <em>who knows?</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  <p><em>Egg Support:</em> Herbie now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library to
    simplify expressions. Egg is roughly thirty times faster than
    Herbie's existing simplifier, making Herbie with Egg roughly twice
    as fast overall. Egg is packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so
    it should be transparently usable on all platforms.

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Simplification now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library;
    Herbie's existing e-graph library has been spun out as
    the <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>
    library, which can be used by other Racket projects.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has gained support
    for <i>movability</i> flags, which generalize the floating-point
    exactness and overflow flags. This significantly speeds up certain
    cases of sampling, where too much time is spent sampling invalid points.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has been spun out as the 
    <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival<a/>
    library, which other Racket projects can now use. Several minor
    bugs in the interval library have been fixed, and support has been
    extended to more functions. Testing has been improved to catch
    such bugs in the future.</li>

    <li>The core program evaluator now operates in batch mode,
    speeding up cases where Herbie generates thousands of program
    candidates.</li>

    <li>An exponential behavior in the rewrite algorithm was fixed by
    adding a cache, eliminating one common cause of timeouts.</li>

    <li>Herbie's "final simplify" step no longer does constant
    folding, eliminating a rare source of accuracy regression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Misleading sentences were stricken from the documentation,
    which should now be a bit clearer and more approachable.</li>

    <li>If a precondition is unsatisfiable, Herbie now names the
    correct variable when reporting the error.</li>

    <li>Herbie now tries just a little hard to select simpler
    expressions when optimizing for accuracy. We've heard a lot of
    feedback about Herbie's confusing and weird results. This change
    does not totally fix the issue, but should help a bit.</li>

    <li>Herbie now aggregates profile information across a whole
    report and presents it in an interactive, JavaScript-enabled form
    on the "Metrics" page. This should help the developers continue to
    speed up Herbie.</li>

    <li>Some "internal" measures that Herbie presents on its report
    page now show the correct data.</li>

    <li>The <code>:spec</code> property and <code>let*</code>
    construct are now supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Many obsolete functions and data structures have been removed.
    This makes Herbie easier to develop. A cost of this change is that
    pre-1.4 seeds will produce different results on Herbie 1.4 due to
    switching to a standard random-number API.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for multi- and mixed-precision operations
    continues to improve, though there is still more work to do before
    this task can be called "done".</li>

    <li>Herbie's code base was reorganized. The increasingly-important
    web version is now spread across multiple files with stronger
    interfaces between them.</li>

    <li>Herbie now uses Github Actions, not Travis, as its continuous
    integration service. Right now the effects are minor, but we hope
    to leverage Github Actions more in the future.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for complex number arithmetic has been
    extracted to
    an <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/complex-herbie">external
    library</a>. The support remains in beta, but will no longer be a
    standard part of Herbie. In the future we hope to provide a
    standard API that complex number arithmetic can leverage, but
    right now the divorce is only partially complete.</li>

    <li>Several herbie dependencies have been spun out as libraries,
    including the C compiler
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/fpbench">fpbench</a>),
    the e-graph implementation
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>),
    and the interval library
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>).
    Separating out these components will make them easier for others
    to use.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
