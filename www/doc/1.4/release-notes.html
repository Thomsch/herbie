    <h1>Herbie 1.4 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.4! This release focuses on <em>who knows?</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard at
    work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  <p><em>Egg Support:</em> Herbie now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library to
    simplify expressions. Egg is roughly a hundred times faster than
    Herbie's existing simplifier; Herbie with Egg is roughly twice as
    fast overall. Egg is packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so it
    should be transparently usable on all platforms.

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Simplification now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library;
    Herbie's existing e-graph library has been spun out as
    the <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>
    library, which can be used by other Racket projects.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has gained support
    for <i>movability flags</i>, which allow Herbie to detect and skip
    unavoidable overflow.</li>

    <li>The core program evaluator now operates in batch mode,
    speeding up cases where Herbie generates thousands of program
    candidates.</li>

    <li>The interval arithmetic library has been spun out as the 
    <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>
    library, which other Racket projects can now use. Several minor
    bugs in the interval library have been fixed, and support has been
    extended to more functions. Testing has been improved to catch
    such bugs in the future.</li>

    <li>Exponential growth in the rewrite algorithm is fixed by adding
    a cache, eliminating a common cause of timeouts.</li>

    <li>Herbie's "final simplify" step no longer does constant
    folding, eliminating a rare source of accuracy regression.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The documentation is now be a bit clearer and more
    approachable.</li>

    <li>Herbie now blames the correct variable if the precondition is
    unsatisfiable.</li>

    <li>The <code>:spec</code> property and <code>let*</code>
    construct are now supported.</li>

    <li>Herbie now tries a little hard to produce simpler expressions.
    This change won't totally fix Herbie's weird output, but should
    help a bit.</li>

    <li>Herbie now aggregates profile information across a whole
    report and presents it in an interactive, JavaScript-enabled form
    on the "Metrics" page. This should help us keep speeding up
    Herbie.</li>

    <li>Some "internal" measures on the details page now show correct
    data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Several herbie dependencies have been spun out as libraries,
    including the C compiler
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/fpbench">fpbench</a>),
    the e-graph implementation
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>),
    and the interval library
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>).
    Others can now use and maintain these components.</li>

    <li>Many obsolete functions and data structures have been removed.
    As a result, pre-1.4 seeds will produce different results on
    Herbie 1.4 due to switching random-number algorithms.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for multi- and mixed-precision operations
    continues to improve, though there is still more work to do before
    this task can be called "done".</li>

    <li>The code base was reorganized to split the web code across
    multiple files with stronger interfaces between them.</li>

    <li>Herbie now uses Github Actions, not Travis, as its continuous
    integration service. Right now the effects are minor, but we hope
    to leverage Github Actions more in the future.</li>

    <li>Herbie's support for complex number arithmetic has been
    extracted to a beta-quality
    <a href="https://github.com/herbie-fp/complex-herbie">external
    library</a>. In the future we hope to provide a standard plugin
    API not only for complex numbers but also vectors, matrices, and
    other mathematical objects.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
