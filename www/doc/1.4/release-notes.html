    <h1>Herbie 1.4 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.4! This release continues a focus on speed and predictability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard
    at work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  <p><em>Faster simplification:</em> Herbie now uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library to
  simplify expressions. Egg is roughly thirty times faster than
  Herbie's existing simplifier, making Herbie roughly twice as fast
  overall. Egg is packaged for Windows, macOS, and Linux, so it should
  be transparently usable on all platforms. </p>

  <p><em>Fewer timeouts:</em> We've fixed several
  accidentally-exponential algorithms in Herbie, which should
  significantly reduce the number of timeouts you experience in
  Herbie.</p>

  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Simplification now uses
    the <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/egg">Egg</a> library;
    Herbie's existing e-graph library has been spun out as
    the <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph<a/>
    library, which can be used by other Racket projects.</li>
    <li>The interval arithmetic library has gained support
    for <i>movability</i> flags, which generalize the floating-point
    exactness and overflow flags. This significantly speeds up certain
    cases of sampling, where too much time is spent sampling invalid points.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>:spec</code> property and <code>let*</code> construct are now supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Several herbie dependencies have been spun out as libraries,
    including the C compiler
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/fpbench">fpbench</a>),
    the e-graph implementation
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/regraph">regraph</a>),
    and the interval library
    (<a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/rival">rival</a>).
    Separating out these components will make them easier for others
    to use.</li>
    <li>Many obsolete functions and data structures have been removed.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're excited to continue to improve Herbie and make it more
    useful to scientists, engineers, and programmers around the world.
    We've got a lot of features we're excited to work on in the coming
    months. Please
