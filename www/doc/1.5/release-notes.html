    <h1>Herbie 1.5 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
    Herbie 1.5! This release focuses on XXX and YYY.
  </p>

  <p>
    Herbie automatically improves the accuracy of floating point
    expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and surprises that so
    often occur when working with floating point. Since
    our <a href="../../pldi15.html">PLDI'15 paper</a>, we've been hard
    at work making Herbie more versatile and easier to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Major features of this release</h2>

  </figure>


  <h2>Improvement to core algorithm</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A new multiprecision tuner allows Herbie to generate
    expressions with multiple precisions.</li>
    <li>The series expansion engine was substantially improved, which
    both reduces timeouts and improves results substantially.</li>
    <li>A new symmetric expressions engine detects cases where
    variables can be sorted to improve precision.</li>
    <li>A new "retirement community" data structure allows Herbie to
    consider more candidate programs, and thus produces better,
    simpler results.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usability improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can now give Herbie FPCore input in the web interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Code Cleanup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Herbie timeline data structure (which powers "Metrics"
    pages) has been dramatically improved, making it easier to add
    more metrics in the future.</li>
    <li>The Herbie interactive main loop has been simplified, making
    it easier to understand and reproduce Herbie bugs.</li>
    <li>The <code>egg-herbie</code> support package has been merged
    into Herbie proper. This means that if you want to install Herbie
    from source, you will now need a Rust compiler.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>precision:double</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Use the <code>:precision</code> flag instead.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>setup:early-exit</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Herbie is fast enough now that it's not that
    important any more!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We're want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
